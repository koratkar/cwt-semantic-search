# Conversations with Tyler Semantic Search

Search the transcript history of Conversations with Tyler using the power of embeddings and semantic search. [Try it out](https://koratkar.github.io/cwt-semantic-search).

A few features will be added before I share this with more people:
- [ ] [tail free sampling](https://www.trentonbricken.com/Tail-Free-Sampling/) on the top similarity results (this is back-end)
- [ ] a cron job so that new conversations are uploaded to vector database automatically (this is back-end) â€“ last podcast is #228
